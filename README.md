# Clojure-projects
Turtle graphics and drawing palette created using Clojure Script, Reagent, HTML, Clojure library Quil

Turtle Graphics:
Supported the turtle operations moving, turning, and raising/lowering a pen to draw, undo, step and run. Built the application to run in two modes: run and step. In the step mode the user can step the program forward one operation by pressing the forward arrow key. The user can undo the last operation by pressing the back arrow key. In the run mode the turtle program is executed without the user having to press the arrow keys. 

Drawing Palette:
 Developed an application that displays a drawing area, a palette to select a drawing mode, and undo button in a web browser. Supported drawing lines, circles and rectangles. The drawing area of the program retains all figures drawn on it until the user clears the screen or undoes operations. Undo will undo drawing of figures and the drawing mode. It is an integration of Clojure script and Reagent and HTML.
